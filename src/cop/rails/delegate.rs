/// Rails/Delegate cop detects method definitions that simply delegate to another object,
/// suggesting the use of Rails' `delegate` macro instead.
///
/// ## Investigation findings (2026-03-10)
///
/// **FP root causes (49 FP):**
/// - Missing `module_function` check: RuboCop skips methods in modules that declare
///   `module_function`. Our cop was flagging these methods incorrectly.
/// - Missing `private :method_name` handling: The `is_private_or_protected` utility
///   only checked for standalone `private` keyword and inline `private def`, not
///   the `private :method_name` form that makes a specific method private after definition.
///
/// **FN root causes (136 FN):**
/// - Missing prefixed delegation detection: When `EnforceForPrefixed: true` (default),
///   `def bar_foo; bar.foo; end` should be flagged as a delegation that can use
///   `delegate :foo, to: :bar, prefix: true`. Our cop only matched exact method names.
///
/// **Fixes applied:**
/// - Added `module_function` detection via line scanning in enclosing scope
/// - Added `private :method_name` form detection
/// - Added prefixed delegation matching when `EnforceForPrefixed: true`
/// - Extended prefix skip (for `EnforceForPrefixed: false`) to all receiver types
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-14): FP=20
///
/// **FP root cause**: `is_in_module_function_scope` only scanned BACKWARDS from the def
/// for `module_function`. Patterns like `end; module_function :adapters` (inline after
/// the def's `end`) and `module_function :method_name` declared later in the module body
/// were missed. RuboCop's `module_function_declared?` walks ALL descendants of the
/// ancestor module — both before and after the def.
///
/// Fix: Added forward scan from the def line that checks if any subsequent line in the
/// same scope contains `module_function` (including `module_function :name` symbol forms).
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-15): FP=12
///
/// **FP root cause 1**: `is_in_module_function_scope` backward scan stopped at `class `
/// boundaries. When a class was nested inside a module that declared `module_function`
/// (e.g., `module Open4; module_function :open4; class SpawnError; def exitstatus`),
/// the backward scan would hit `class SpawnError` and break before reaching
/// `module_function :open4`. RuboCop's `module_function_declared?` checks ALL ancestors.
///
/// Fix: Changed backward scan to expand the search depth when crossing class boundaries,
/// so `module_function` at the outer module level is still found.
///
/// **FP root cause 2**: Endless methods (`def foo() = expr`) were flagged. RuboCop's
/// NodePattern matches `(def _method_name _args (send ...))` which in Parser gem doesn't
/// match endless defs. In Prism, endless defs have `equal_loc().is_some()`.
///
/// Fix: Skip defs with `equal_loc().is_some()` (endless method syntax).
///
/// **FP root cause 3**: `is_private_or_protected` (in util.rs) didn't match `private `
/// with a trailing space on its own line. The check compared against exact bytes
/// `b"private"` and specific continuations (`\n`, `\r`, ` #`) but not trailing spaces.
///
/// Fix: Added `starts_with(b"private ")` match that validates the remainder is
/// only whitespace (to avoid matching `private :method_name` or `private def foo`).
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-15): FP=1, FN=102
///
/// **FN root cause 1 (~majority)**: Endless methods (`def foo = bar.foo`) were incorrectly
/// skipped. The previous investigation assumed RuboCop's `(def ...)` NodePattern didn't
/// match endless defs, but corpus data proves RuboCop DOES flag them. In Prism, endless
/// methods have the body as a direct child (not wrapped in StatementsNode).
///
/// Fix: Removed the `equal_loc().is_some()` early return. Added fallback path that
/// handles the body as a direct CallNode when it's not a StatementsNode.
///
/// **FN root cause 2**: Prefixed delegation via `self.class` receiver
/// (e.g., `def class_name; self.class.name; end`) was not detected. `get_receiver_name`
/// only returned names for receiverless calls, but `self.class` has a receiver (`self`).
/// RuboCop's `determine_prefixed_method_receiver_name` returns `receiver.method_name`
/// for send nodes, which would be `"class"` for `self.class`.
///
/// Fix: Added handling in `get_receiver_name` for call nodes with a `self` receiver,
/// returning the method name (e.g., `"class"` for `self.class`).
///
/// **FP (1, antiwork/gumroad)**: `def to_stripejs_customer_id; to_stripejs_customer.id; end`
/// flagged by nitrocop but not RuboCop. Likely a private/module_function scope issue
/// in the full file that our line-based scanning doesn't detect. Cannot verify without
/// corpus file access.
///
/// **Remaining FNs**: 102 FNs in corpus, mostly in files not locally available.
/// Many are likely the endless method and self.class patterns now fixed. Others may
/// involve scope/visibility patterns not yet detected by line-based scanning.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-15): FP=2, FN=28
///
/// **FN root cause 1**: `is_private_symbol_arg` was too broad — it matched
/// `private :method_name, :other` (multi-symbol calls). RuboCop's `VisibilityHelp`
/// pattern `(send nil? VISIBILITY_SCOPES (sym %method_name))` only matches single-symbol
/// `private :method_name`. Multi-symbol calls like `private :[]=, :set_element` do NOT
/// make the method private for delegate purposes.
///
/// Fix: Added comma check in `is_private_symbol_arg` to reject multi-symbol calls.
///
/// **FN root cause 2**: `is_in_module_function_scope` forward scan was too broad:
/// (a) matched `module_function` in comments (e.g., `# module_function...`),
/// (b) matched `module_function` in nested scopes at deeper indentation (e.g.,
/// `namespace :parallel do; module X; module_function; end; end`).
///
/// Fix: Added comment filtering (strip `#`-prefixed content) and indent check
/// (`indent <= def_col`) in the forward scan to restrict matches to the same scope.
///
/// **FP 1 (antiwork/gumroad)**: `def to_stripejs_customer_id; to_stripejs_customer.id; end`
/// correctly matched as prefixed delegation but RuboCop doesn't flag it. Without corpus
/// file access, cannot determine visibility context (likely private block earlier in file).
///
/// **FP 2 (palkan/anyway_config)**: `def clear() = value.clear` — endless method
/// delegation. RuboCop doesn't flag it. Without corpus access, cannot determine visibility
/// context (likely private block earlier in file).
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-16): FP=2, FN=24
///
/// **FN root cause**: `is_in_module_function_scope` forward scan used substring matching
/// (`windows().any()`) to detect `module_function`. This falsely matched identifiers
/// containing `module_function` as a substring, e.g., `register_module_function`,
/// `module_function?`, `make_module_function`. This was the primary FN source —
/// particularly in yard (10 FNs), where `lib/yard/handlers/base.rb` has delegation
/// methods like `def owner; parser.owner end` followed later by method
/// `def register_module_function(object)` which contains the substring.
///
/// Fix: Replaced `windows()` substring matching with `has_module_function_token()`
/// that checks word boundaries — `module_function` must be preceded and followed by
/// non-identifier characters (not alphanumeric, `_`, `?`, `!`).
///
/// **FP 1 & 2**: Both FPs remain — they are caused by visibility context (private
/// block earlier in the file) that our line-based scanning doesn't detect. The methods
/// ARE valid delegation patterns that RuboCop flags when public, confirmed via testing.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-18): FP=2, FN=14
///
/// **FP root causes (2 FP — gumroad and anyway_config)**:
/// Both cases have `module_function` declared in an OUTER ancestor module, AFTER a nested
/// class/module definition in that outer module. The forward scan in `is_in_module_function_scope`
/// broke as soon as it encountered a `class`/`module` at `indent < def_col`, stopping before
/// it could reach the `module_function` in the outer scope.
///
/// Example (gumroad): `def to_stripejs_customer_id` inside `module ExtensionMethods` (indent 4).
/// After `ExtensionMethods` ends, `class StripeJs` appears at indent 2 (the outer scope).
/// The scan stopped at `class StripeJs`, never reaching `module_function` at indent 2 in
/// `module StripePaymentMethodHelper`. RuboCop's `module_function_declared?` checks ALL
/// ancestors, so it finds it.
///
/// Fix: Changed forward scan to track `sibling_scope_depth`. When `class`/`module` at
/// `indent < def_col` is encountered, increment depth (skip its body). When the matching
/// `end` is seen, decrement. Only check `module_function` when `sibling_scope_depth == 0`.
/// This allows scanning past sibling class/module bodies to find `module_function` in the
/// outer ancestor scope.
///
/// **FN root causes (14 FN — mongomapper, rouge, rails, coderay, etc.)**:
/// All FNs involve delegations via `def foo; self.class.foo; end` inside a module that
/// has a sibling `module ClassMethods` (or `class << self`) at the same indent level.
/// The sibling has `private` declared inside it at the same indent. The forward scan in
/// `is_private_or_protected` (which scans top-to-bottom) set `in_private = true` when
/// it encountered `private` inside the sibling, and never reset it when the sibling's
/// `end` was reached (because `end` at `indent == def_col` did not reset in_private).
///
/// Example (mongomapper): `module ClassMethods` at indent 6, with `private` at indent 6
/// inside it. After `end` of ClassMethods, `def associations` at indent 6 was incorrectly
/// considered private.
///
/// Fix: Added `peer_scope_depth` tracking in `is_private_or_protected`. When `class`/`module`
/// at `indent == def_col` is encountered, increment depth (entering a peer scope). When `end`
/// at `indent == def_col` decrements it to 0 (exiting peer scope), `in_private` updates are
/// skipped while inside the peer scope. This prevents `private` from inside sibling
/// class/modules from bleeding into instance methods at the same level.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-18): FP=1, FN=2
///
/// **FP (rubocop, line 88)**: Already fixed by prior `is_private_or_protected` improvements.
/// `private` at same indent as `def` in deeply nested class correctly detected.
///
/// **FN (aruba, line 149)**: Already fixed by prior `peer_scope_depth` improvements.
/// `def mode; @announcer.mode; end` after `public` keyword correctly detected.
///
/// **FN (asciidoctor, line 66)**: `def now; ::Time.now; end` inside `if/else` block after
/// `private`. RuboCop's `node_visibility` uses AST sibling checks — a `def` inside an
/// `if/else` body is NOT a sibling of `private` in the class body, so RuboCop considers
/// it public. Our line-based `is_private_or_protected` incorrectly set `in_private = true`
/// because `private` at indent 4 <= def_col 6.
///
/// Fix: Added `is_inside_conditional_block()` check in the delegate cop. After
/// `is_private_or_protected` returns true, scan backwards from the def for block-opening
/// keywords (if/unless/case/else/elsif/while/etc.) at lower indent. If found, the def
/// is inside a conditional block and `private` doesn't apply per RuboCop's AST semantics.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-19): FP=8, FN=0
///
/// **FP root cause (all 8)**: `is_inside_conditional_block()` backward scan didn't stop
/// at `end` keywords at indent < def_col. It scanned through sibling method/block bodies
/// and falsely matched conditional keywords (rescue/ensure/elsif/if) from INSIDE those
/// other methods. Examples:
/// - rails/rails: `ensure` at indent 2 inside a test method → falsely marked `def mkdir`
///   (at indent 4 after `private`) as inside a conditional block.
/// - ruby/debug: `elsif` at indent 6 inside `setup_sigdump` → falsely marked `private def
///   config` (at indent 12) as inside a conditional.
/// - antiwork/gumroad: `rescue` at indent 2 inside other methods → falsely marked
///   `def paypal_api` (at indent 4 after `private`) as inside a conditional.
///
/// Fix: Added `end` at indent < def_col as a stop condition in the backward scan of
/// `is_inside_conditional_block()`. When scanning backwards, an `end` at lower indent
/// closes a sibling scope — conditional keywords beyond it are in a different scope and
/// should not affect the current def.
///
/// ## Reverted fix attempt (2026-03-23, commit 0956d7b0)
///
/// Attempted to fix FP on parameter receivers and FN inside else blocks.
/// Introduced FP=1 on standard corpus; reverted in 1bf1bea3.
///
/// **FP=1 (is_inside_conditional_block overrides private in same branch):**
/// `def connection` (indent 6) inside an `else` branch (indent 4) preceded by
/// `private` (indent 6) in the same else branch. `is_private_or_protected`
/// returns true, but `is_inside_conditional_block` also returns true (finds
/// `else` at lower indent). The skip logic `is_private && !is_inside_conditional`
/// evaluates to false, so the private method gets flagged. But `private` is in
/// the SAME conditional branch as the def — it should still apply. Fix: when
/// `is_inside_conditional_block` is true, check whether `private` appears AFTER
/// the enclosing conditional keyword and BEFORE the def (same nesting level),
/// which means private still applies within that branch.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-26): representative FN fixtures pass, corpus FN remain
///
/// Added the current representative corpus FN snippets to the fixture:
/// `@attribute_manager.add_word_pair(start, stop, name)`, `@attrs[n]`,
/// `@items << item`, `@parts.empty?`, `@parts.length`, and `def pop = frames.pop`.
/// The cop matches those cases in the unit fixture, so the remaining corpus FN=78
/// are not caused by the local delegation matcher.
///
/// Direct corpus reproduction showed a split between explicit-file and repo-root runs:
/// - Passing a missed file explicitly to nitrocop with the corpus config reports
///   the expected offenses (for example `rdoc/markup.rb` lines 594/601/614 and
///   `rdoc/markup/list.rb` lines 28/54/61).
/// - Running the same repo through `bench/corpus.run_nitrocop(..., cop='Rails/Delegate')`
///   omits those files entirely from the offense set.
///
/// The same pattern reproduced for `amuta__kumi__790c2e0`:
/// `lib/kumi/core/analyzer/passes/lir/lower_pass.rb:48` is flagged when passed
/// explicitly, but disappears in the repo-root corpus run.
///
/// Conclusion: the remaining corpus FN are dominated by whole-repo execution
/// dropping or suppressing eligible files before this cop runs. The likely fix
/// is outside this cop (file discovery / global exclude / repo-root config
/// handling in `fs.rs`, `linter.rs`, or `config/mod.rs`). No narrow matcher
/// change here fixes the corpus gap without papering over the real issue.
///
/// ## Investigation (2026-03-30): FP=2, FN=2
///
/// - FP: parameter/local-variable receivers like `def delete(x); x.delete(x); end`
///   are not matched by RuboCop's node pattern, so `LocalVariableReadNode`
///   receivers and prefixed names derived from them must be ignored.
/// - FP: Prism reports `def !@` as `name == "!"` while the source spelling is
///   `!@`. Matching on `name_loc()` keeps unary `!@` from falsely looking like a
///   delegation to unary `!`.
/// - FN: outer `private` leaked into defs nested inside non-scope bodies
///   (`Struct.new do ... end`, `if/else`, etc.). RuboCop only applies outer
///   visibility to sibling defs in the same scope, so nested bodies now get an
///   AST-aware override unless they declare visibility inline or within that same
///   nested body.
/// - FP: heredoc help text containing prose like `do not` was scanned as Ruby by
///   the nested-body override, so private methods after a heredoc were treated as
///   public. Heredoc line ranges are now ignored while scanning for enclosing
///   block/conditional openers.
